# Feature Selection

## Recursive/Backward Feature Selection
We used recursive/backward feature selection to eliminate unnecessary features from data in order to improve model accuracy. For example, logistic regression models need little to no multicollinearity in order to preform well. We decided to also use cross validation to find the optimal number of features. 

## Forward Feature Selection
We also wanted to see how a different feature selection method would influence model accuracy.
